## 🛠️ Available Tools

## 🚀 WordPress Embedding

Each tool can be embedded in WordPress using URL parameters:

```
https://your-domain.com/?embed=true&tool=TOOL_ID
```

**Tool IDs** (full registry in `src/utils/toolRegistry.js`):
- `tone` - Emotional Tone + Filler Checker
- `palindrome` - Palindrome Checker
- `hard-words-quiz` - Hard Words Spelling Quiz

An unknown `tool` value renders a visible "Tool not found" message with a link
to the tools index (it no longer falls back silently to a default tool), so
double-check the ID against `src/utils/toolRegistry.js` before shipping an embed.

**Example WordPress shortcode:**
```html
<iframe src="https://your-tools-site.com/?embed=true&tool=tone" 
        width="100%" height="800" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

- **Brand Integration**: Designed for [Become a Writer Today](https://becomeawritertoday.com) with proper attribution
